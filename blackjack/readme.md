# deployment
1. Sign up for a Netlify account at https://app.netlify.com/signup.

2. Once you've signed up and logged in to your Netlify account, click on the "New site from Git" button on the dashboard.

3. Connect your GitHub account to Netlify and select the repository that contains your project.

4. In the deploy settings, set the build command to npm run build if you're using a package manager like npm or yarn build if you're using yarn. This will generate the optimized production build of your project.

5. Set the publish directory to build/ if that's the directory where your optimized production build is located.

6. Finally, click on the "Deploy site" button to deploy your project on Netlify.

Once your project is deployed, you'll be able to see the URL of your live site on the Netlify dashboard. You can also configure custom domain, HTTPS, and other settings from the Netlify settings page.

That's it! Your project is now live and ready to be viewed by the world. Congratulations!
